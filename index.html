This blog is going to be a brand new version of my first blog started on 2012 using [Octorpress](http://octopress.org/). I am moving to [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) by [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) for usability reasons: writing a blog post was too complicated.
Now, writing a blog post is as easy as writing a Python Notebook. As extra bonus, my readers can run code snippets on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

The original web site of [Spaghetti Optimization](http://stegua.github.io/) will stay online, 
at least until I will be able to re-post everything on this new platform.
