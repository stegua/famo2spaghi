This blog is going to be a brand new version of my first blog started on 2012 using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). I am moving to [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) by [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) for usability reasons: writing a blog post was too complicated with Octopress. Now, writing a blog post with fastapages is as easy as writing a Python Notebook. As extra bonus, you can run my posts directly on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

The original [Spaghetti Optimization](http://stegua.github.io/) blog will stay online until I will find the time to re-post everything on this new platform.
