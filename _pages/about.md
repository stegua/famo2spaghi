### Credits
This blog started in 2010 after several discussions with my friend and coauthor [Stefano Coniglio](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/maths/about/staff/sc2r15.page),who always proofreads my posts. Though I have not convinced him to write any guest post yet, he is a contributor of this blog: **thanks Stefano**!

Another friend and coauthor that supports this blog is [Marco Chiarandini](https://imada.sdu.dk/~marco/). I do not know when he finds the time to proofread my posts, but he does, with the same seriousness as if he were reviewing a paper: **thanks Marco**!
